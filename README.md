# ProbabilityCardGame
Purpose of the game: Use probability to create a interactive card game and learn python while doing it.

8/3/17: Finished Red / Black game where you press either the Red or Black button while a card is drawn randomly and it tells you if you guessed correctly or not. Pictures have not yet been uploaded so the program on its own will not work.

9/4/17: Finished Black Jack game.

9/12/17: Uploaded an installer for the game. Run it and run RunningGame.exe when finished to play.
